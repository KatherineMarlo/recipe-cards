### What I learned

In this project, I had the opportunity to delve deeper into using Flexbox for layout purposes. Through experimentation and practice, I gained a better understanding of how to utilize Flexbox properties effectively to create more responsive and visually appealing designs. I'm particularly proud of how I was able to replicate the design closely, which demonstrates my improved proficiency in using Flexbox to achieve the desired layout and alignment of elements. This experience has not only enhanced my skills in front-end development but also boosted my confidence in tackling more complex layout challenges in future projects.
